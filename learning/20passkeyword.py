# What is pass in Python?
#
# It’s a no-operation (no-op) statement.
#
# It literally does nothing when executed.
#
# Used as a placeholder to keep the code syntactically correct when you don’t want to write logic yet.

def todo_function():
    pass

class MyClass:
    pass

x = 10
if x > 5:
    pass  # placeholder for future logic
else:
    print("x <= 5")
