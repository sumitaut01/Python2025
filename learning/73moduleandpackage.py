# 23. What are Modules and Packages in Python?
# A module is a single file that contains Python code (functions, variables, classes) which can be reused in
# other programs. You can think of it as a code library.
# For example: math is a built-in module that provides math functions like sqrt(), pi, etc.
#

# import math
# print(math.sqrt(16))
# Output
# 4.0
# package is a collection of related modules stored in a directory. It helps in organizing and grouping modules together for easier management. For example: The numpy package contains multiple modules for numerical operations.
#
# To create a package, the directory must contain a special file named __init__.py.
