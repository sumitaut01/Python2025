# 18. What is a Variable Scope in Python?
# The location where we can find a variable and also access it if required is called the scope of a variable.
#
# Python Local variable: Local variables are those that are initialized within a function and are unique to that function. A local variable cannot be accessed outside of the function.
# Python Global variables: Global variables are the ones that are defined and declared outside any function and are not specified to any function.
# Module-level scope: It refers to the global objects of the current module accessible in the program.
# Outermost scope: It refers to any built-in names that the program can call. The name referenced is located last among the objects in this scope.
